                <p>
                    Here’s the quick and dirty lowdown on me: I was the weird artsy kid in a small town in Northeastern
                    Wisconsin, who left at age 17 to pursue her dreams in the big city.
                </p>

                <p>I attended Columbia College Chicago, where I eventually graduated with a BFA in Art History and a
                    minor in photography. I very briefly worked in a museum in downtown Chicago, but it should come as
                    no surprise that “pursuing your passions” and “making enough money to eat things other than instant
                    ramen” do not always go hand-in-hand. Which more or less brings us to where I am now, going back to
                    my creative roots, only this time looking to add some technical skills to back them up. </p>
